# Motion Game


## Instructions 

This repository is our school project. 
The aim is to represent movement. 
With my team, we chose to create a game with Unity based on the user's movements.

## Game Pitch

In this horizontally-scrolling infinite race game, players take on the role of a penguin in the world of Christmas, who must avoid the various obstacles he encounters by jumping and ducking. 
These actions are controlled by precise physical movements to be performed by players in space. 
These commands evolve as the game progresses. 
Points are scored according to the time spent before failure. 
You have to stay as long as possible.

## Installation

To test this project, you can clone it with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IlanOu/Motion-game.git
```

Be sure to use the Unity version: `2022.3.5`.

## Project Progress

The game is still in development. 
The project deadline is `08/12/2023`.
The project may be maintained thereafter, but nothing is guaranteed.
